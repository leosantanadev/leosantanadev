# Leonardo Sanatana


I have experience in python but today I'm studying react and the javascript ecosystem.

I studied React Native for mobile applications and I'm starting to study Node.js on the backend

I'm 17 years old, i have an acceptable level of English and I'm looking for a job opportunity both nationally and internationally.
